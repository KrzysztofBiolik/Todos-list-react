You can try for yourself how the currency exchange works at this link.

## How does the to-do list work?

The to-do list web page is a form that has one field for entering new tasks and a button that, when clicked, adds a new task and automatically sets the focus to the form field to be able to enter new tasks. The entered tasks appear in the form of a list, and each of them has two interaction buttons. The first button allows you to toggle the execution of the task. Completed tasks receive a strikethrough line for the task text. The second button allows you to remove tasks from the list. If the task list is not empty, two buttons appear. The first one is used to mark all tasks as completed. When all tasks are completed, this button is disabled. The second button is used to toggle the hiding of completed tasks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
